### Instructions for the project

Dear students,


Here is some information about the group project. We expect you to form groups of 4 people (3 may be possible as well, and we can make exceptions for groups of only 2). Your first assignment is to define the project, and the deadline is Sunday Feb 13:

Create a slack channel with all members + Olivier + Charles. You can join our slack with the following invitation link:


https://join.slack.com/t/dstelecom1420-npn9730/shared_invite/zt-11tspuwc2-SN8WWa425LYctrKwYfTYag


Fill also this spreadsheet with the project information (name + group)

Send via Slack a 5 line description of what you will do including the description of your problem

Create a dedicated github repository for the project and link it in the header of the slack channel.

Here is a template of questions you need to think about when preparing this:

What will be the input/outputs of the model?

What is the objective function?

How do you plan to quantify success (e.g. metrics, cross-validation splits, some sort of live deployment)?

What dataset(s) do you plan to use (with links)?

Do you plan to collect your own labels? If so, how? How many hours do you expect it to take to collect enough labels?

Which model architecture(s) do you plan to implement?

How would you qualitatively check the quality of the annotation of your training / evaluation dataset?

How would you qualitatively check the quality of the predictions of your model?

What would be the anticipated business, social or ethical impacts if you were to deploy the results of your project in a real life setting?

From this description we’ll validate the project or drive you towards a more feasible one.

For this project, it’s authorised to to reuse some existing open source code and/or pre-trained models but it’s very important:

to always credit original work by linking to the original code repo in your source code / readme file and project presentation;

to clearly state what is your own original work from what is adapted from an external source.

You may ask us any questions anytime via slack / email (preferably slack), we might even do live sessions to answer technical questions if requested.

If you have no idea, feel free to ask suggestions telling us if you are more interested in applied problems (which domain?) or more research aspects (e.g. reproducing the results of a paper).


Best regards,


Olivier & Charles
